# This is my User Centric Frontend-Development Milestone Project

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program. 

Please check out my website [here](https://aguipedro.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-1Project/)!

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like GitHub, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Project Objective

The objective is to create an appealing personal portfolio site, and present myself in best light possible and get hired. 

## Project Inspiration
The whole project is based on the Milestone project and love running project learned skills. Most of the codes used are from both projects. So, for this Milestone project I have used  CSS and User Centric Frontend skills learned so far in this course.

## Wireframes
Potential features to include:
Tell about educational history and work experience.

Tell about skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.

Provide basic personal information and contact information for recruiters.

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using GITPod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
